# Chromosome-Quotient

The chomosome quotient (CQ) pipeline is method developed by A. Brantley Hall to identify Y chromosome sequences. It consists of two primary components: CQ-calculate.pl to identify Y chromosome sequences and caldera.pl to take the Y chromosome sequences and identify interesting Y chromosome genes. A third component, irukandji.pl, is a parallel method to CQ-calculate.pl to unambiguously identify Y chromosome sequences using a kmer-based approach.
